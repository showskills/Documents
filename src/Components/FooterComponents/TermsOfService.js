<h1><strong>15. User Services</strong></h1>

<p>Upon the Buyer awarding a Project or Contest to the Seller, and the Seller's acceptance on the Website, or the purchase of an item by a Buyer from the Seller, the Buyer and Seller will be deemed to have entered into a User Contract under which the Buyer agrees to purchase, and the Seller agrees to deliver the Seller Services. You agree not to enter into any contractual provisions in conflict with the User Agreement.</p>

<p>You are solely responsible for ensuring that you comply with your obligations to other Users. If you do not, you may become liable to that User. You must ensure that you are aware of any domestic laws (including common law), international laws, statutes, ordinances and regulations relevant to you as a Buyer or Seller, or in any other uses you make of the Website.</p>

<p>If another User breaches any obligation to you, you are solely responsible for enforcing any rights that you may have. For the avoidance of doubt, we have no responsibility for enforcing any rights under a User Contract.</p>

<p>Depending on their jurisdiction, Sellers and Buyers may have rights under statutory warranties that cannot lawfully be excluded. Nothing in this User Agreement is intended to override a right that by applicable law may not be excluded. Nothing in this User Agreement is intended to violate any laws relating to unfair contracts, and this agreement has been specifically redrafted to ensure compliance with unfair contracts legislation. To the extent that any component of this User Agreement is in conflict with inalienable rights under local laws, all parties intend for this agreement to be read down only insofar as to be in compliance with such local laws and no further.</p>

<p>Each User acknowledges and agrees that the relationship between Buyers and Sellers is that of an independent contractor. Nothing in this User Agreement creates a partnership, joint venture, agency or employment relationship between Users. Nothing in this User Agreement shall in any way be construed as forming a joint venture, partnership or an employer-employee relationship between Showskills and any User.</p>

<h1><strong>16. Special Provisions for Local Jobs</strong></h1>

<p>Each User acknowledges:</p>

<p>1. Showskills does not review, approve, recommend or verify any of the credentials, licences or statements of capability in relation to Local Jobs (or, for the avoidance of doubt, any non Local Jobs on the Website);</p>

<p>2. Showskills provides matchmaking and platform services only. Users agree that Showskills has no liability for any other aspect of service delivery or interaction between Buyer and Seller. Showskills is not a party to any disputes between Buyer and Seller, although we provide a dispute resolution mechanism to assist the parties in resolving issues;</p>

<p>3. Showskills may from time to time include map features and Showskills may display the location of Users to persons browsing the Website on that map. Every Buyer seeking services for Local Jobs will be asked to provide the location where the Local Job is to be performed. You expressly agree that Showskills has no liability for displaying such information.</p>

<p>4. A User must never disclose, in any Project posted, personal details such as the User's name, street number, phone number or the email address in any Project description for a Local Job or in any other public communication on the Website (these may be disclosed for Local Jobs as required in private direct messages);</p>

<p>5. Showskills may collect location related data from you via technologies including but not limited to GPS, IP address location, wifi, and by other methods. This data may be shared in the context of facilitating services for Local Jobs and each User specifically consents to this collection and sharing as part of this agreement;</p>

<p>6. Upon completion of a Local Job Project, Seller User must log on to the Website and click the "Complete" button for that Local Job, as soon as practicable.</p>

<p>7. Failure to complete the service or task will constitute a breach of this User Agreement; and</p>

<p>8. Our fees are applied to the amount of the awarded Seller's bid to perform the services for the Local Job. Any items purchased by the Seller as part of performing the service are between the Buyer and Seller.</p>

<h1><strong>17. Funds</strong></h1>

<p>You may have positive funds in your Account if you have prepaid for fees or charges or for services to be provided to you via the Website. If you are a Seller, you may have positive funds if you have successfully completed a Project, or sold an item, and funds have been released to you. There are also circumstances where funds may have been credited to your Account in relation to an affiliate program or a referral program.</p>

<p>Funds in your Account are held by us in our operating accounts held with financial institutions. Funds in your Account are not held separately by us, and may be commingled with our general operating funds, and/or funds of other User's Accounts.</p>

<p>You are not entitled to any interest, or other earnings for funds that are in your Account.</p>

<p>We may receive interest on funds held by us in our operating accounts from financial institutions with whom we hold our operating accounts. Any such interest earned belongs to us and we will not be liable to any User for any imputed interest on such funds.</p>

<p>If your Account has negative funds, we may:</p>

<p>1. set-off the negative amount with funds that you subsequently receive into your Account;</p>

<p>2. if you have funds in multiple currencies in your Account and one of the currencies becomes negative for any reason, we may set-off the negative amount against funds you maintain in a different currency (at an exchange rate applied by us);</p>

<p>3. reverse payments you have made from your Account to other User Accounts on the Website;</p>

<p>4. deduct amounts you owe us from money you subsequently add or receive into your Account; or</p>

<p>5. immediately suspend or limit your Account until such time as your Account no longer has a negative amount.</p>

<p>In the event that we offset a negative amount of funds pursuant to this section, it may be bundled with another debit coming out of your Account.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to collect any funds owed to us by any other legal means.</p>

<p>You acknowledge and agree that:</p>

<p>1. we are not a bank or other licensed financial institution and do not provide banking services or any financial services to you;</p>

<p>2. the funds shown in your Account (which may include Milestone Payments subject to Section 25, and/or any prepayment of fees and charges which you owe to us) represents our unsecured obligations to you with respect to your rights to direct us to make payment in relation to the purchase and sale of Seller Services through the Website and provision of the Showskills Services;</p>

<p>3. if you were a User acquired in an acquisition and your account was migrated to the Website, we are responsible for your positive funds only to the extent of the legal documentation between us and any acquired marketplace, along with this agreement, and you acknowledge specifically that the onus is on you to confirm the validity of your fund, and that any understatement or misstatement in relation to this is not a claim against us, and belongs with the counterparty of any prior user agreement to which you agreed;</p>

<p>4. to the extent that we are required to release funds from your Account to you, you will become our unsecured creditor until such funds are paid to you;</p>

<p>5. we are not acting as a trustee or fiduciary with respect to such funds or payments;</p>

<p>6. the amount of funds showing in your Account is not insured and is not a guaranteed deposit;</p>

<p>7. funds may only loaded into your Account, or released from your Account, by us and you must only use the mechanisms available on the Website to pay for, or receive funds in respect of Seller Services;</p>

<p>8. any refunds required to be processed in your favour will be returned only to the source of the original deposit, and cannot be redirected to any other payment source;</p>

<p>9. we will hold funds in respect of the amount of your Account (including Milestone Payments, subject to Section 25) in an account held by us with a financial institution (or in any manner that we decide in our sole discretion from time to time) and such funds are not segregated into a separate account; and</p>

<p>10. we may commingle your funds with funds of other Users and our own funds and such commingled funds could be used to pay other Users or for our general corporate purposes or otherwise, however, we will remain obliged to release or refund funds at your direction in accordance with this User Agreement.</p>

<h1><strong>18. Limits &amp; Fraud Prevention</strong></h1>

<p>We reserve the right to suspend a User withdrawal request if the source of the funds is suspected to be fraudulent.</p>

<p>If we become aware that any funds received into an Account from another Account as a result of a fraudulent transaction, this will be reversed immediately. If those funds have already been released to you, you must pay the funds into your Account. If you do not do so, we may suspend, limit or cancel your account, or take action against you to recover those funds.</p>

<p>We may, in our sole discretion, place a limit on any or all of the funds in your Account (thereby preventing any use of the funds) if:</p>

<p>1. we believe there may be an unacceptable level of risk associated with you, your Account, or any or all of your transactions, including if we believe that there is a risk that such funds will be subject to reversal or chargeback;</p>

<p>2. we believe that the beneficiary of the payment is someone other than you;</p>

<p>3. we believe that the payment is being made to a country where we do not offer our Service; or</p>

<p>4. we are required to do so by law or applicable law enforcement agencies.</p>

<p>If you are involved in a dispute, we may (in certain circumstances) place a temporary limit on the funds in your Account to cover the amount of any potential liability. If the dispute is resolved in your favour, we will lift the limit on your funds and those funds may be released to you. If the dispute is not resolved in your favour, we may remove the funds from your Account. We may also place a limit on your account in circumstances where we suspect you of fraudulent or other unacceptable behaviour, while we investigate any such matter.</p>

<h1><strong>19. Refunds</strong></h1>

<p>You may ask for a refund at any time for any funds that you have paid into your Account except if the amount to refund relates to a Milestone Payment subject to Section 25 or relates to fees or charges payable to us.</p>

<p>If the amount the User has asked to refund relates to: (1) a Milestone Payment subject to Section 25, the Dispute Resolution Process may be followed; or (2) our fees and charges, the process set out in the Clause "Disputes with Us" must be followed.</p>

<p>If we agree to the refund, the funds will be received by the User via the same payment method(s) that the User used to make the original payment to us.</p>

<p>We may refund funds to Users irrespective of whether a User has requested funds be refunded if: (1) we are required by law or consider that we are required by law to do so; (2) we determine that refunding funds to the User will avoid any dispute or an increase in our costs; (3) we refund funds to the User in accordance with any refund policy specified by us from time to time; (4) we find out that the original payment made by the User is fraudulent; (5) the User made a duplicate payment in error; or (6) we consider, in our sole opinion, that it is likely that the refund of funds is necessary to avoid a credit card chargeback.</p>

<p>You can request a refund by using our customer support website or emailing us at <a href="https://d.docs.live.net/8ff12ab844b4d8a0/Documents/showskills2021@gmail.com">showskills2021@gmail.com</a>. Once you have made a Milestone Payment subject to Section 25, you expressly agree to use the dispute resolution process in this agreement, expressly agree to be bound by its ruling and expressly agree not to initiate any chargeback request with your card issuer.</p>

<p>If you initiate any chargeback request or other "Request for Information" or similar process, you expressly agree and consent to us to share any and all information in relation to your agreement of these terms and conditions, in order to defeat any such chargeback request.</p>

<p>If you have already initiated a chargeback request with your credit card issuer, you must not request a refund of funds by contacting us and must not seek double recovery.</p>

<p>If we reasonably determine, having considered all the relevant circumstances, that you have made an excessive or unreasonable number of requests to refund funds back to you or chargebacks, we may suspend, limit or close your Account.</p>

<h1><strong>20. Withdrawals</strong></h1>

<p>Your first withdrawal of funds earned may be delayed for up to fifteen days for security and fraud purposes.</p>

<p>Subsequent withdrawals may be delayed for up to fifteen days where our fraud prevention policies require a delay.</p>

<p>We may impose a minimum withdrawal amount for funds earned. This is set out in our schedule of Fees and Charges. The maximum you can withdraw per month is $10,000 unless otherwise specifically agreed with support.</p>

<p>We may require you to be Verified by Showskills before you can withdraw funds from your Showskills Account, irrespective of whether or not a delay has been enforced. For details of how to become Verified by Showskills please read the Know your Customer and Identity Verification Policy.</p>

<p>You acknowledge and agree that we may seek to verify your identity or request additional information from you as part of our anti-fraud and Know Your Customer policy, as outlined in the section on "Identity / Know Your Customer" sections of this agreement.</p>

<h1><strong>21. Chargebacks</strong></h1>

<p>A chargeback (being a challenge to a payment that a User files with their card issuer or financial institution), and any subsequent reversal instruction, is made by the payment product issuer or third parties (such as payment processors) and not by us. We are bound to follow such instructions.</p>

<p>You acknowledge and agree that we will be entitled to recover any chargebacks and reversals that may be imposed on us by a payment product issuer or third parties (such as payment processors) on funds paid to you by Buyers through the Website, as well as any processing or any other fees whatsoever incurred by us on those chargebacks and reversals.</p>

<p>You agree that we may reverse any such payments made to you, which are subject to chargeback or reversal instruction via your payment product issuer or third parties (such as payment processors). If you initiate any chargeback request or other "Request for Information" or similar process, you expressly agree and consent to us to share any and all information in relation to your agreement of these terms and conditions, in order to defeat any such chargeback request.</p>

<h1><strong>22. Inactive Accounts</strong></h1>

<p>User Accounts that have not been logged into for a period of time will incur a maintenance fee per month, until either the account is closed or reactivated, for storage, bandwidth, support and management costs of providing hosting of the User's profile, portfolio storage, listing in directories, promotion of your profile on the Website and elsewhere, provision of the HireMe service, file storage, message transmission, general administrative matters and message and other storage costs.</p>

<p>The length of the period and the amount of the maintenance fee is set out in our schedule of Fees and Charges.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to close an Inactive Account.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to close an account with nil or negative funds.</p>

<h1><strong>23. Right to Refuse Service</strong></h1>

<p>We may close, suspend or limit your access to your Account without reason. Without limiting the foregoing, we may close, suspend or limit your access to your Account:</p>

<p>1. if we determine that you have breached, or are acting in breach of this User Agreement;</p>

<p>2. if you under-bid on any Project in an attempt to renegotiate the actual price privately, to attempt to avoid fees;</p>

<p>3. if we determine that you have infringed legal rights (resulting in actual or potential claims), including infringing Intellectual Property Rights;</p>

<p>4. if we determine that you have engaged, or are engaging, in fraudulent, or illegal activities;</p>

<p>5. you do not respond to account verification requests;</p>

<p>6. you do not complete account verification when requested within 3 months of the date of request;</p>

<p>7. you are the subject of a United Nations, Australian, EU, USA or other applicable sanctions regime, or our banking and payment relationships otherwise preclude us from conducting business with you;</p>

<p>8. to manage any risk of loss to us, a User, or any other person; or</p>

<p>9. for other reasons.</p>

<p>If we close your Account due to your breach of this User Agreement, you may also become liable for certain fees as described in this User Agreement.</p>

<p>Without limiting our other remedies, to the extent you have breached this User Agreement, you must pay us all fees owed to us and reimburse us for all losses and costs (including any and all of our employee time) and reasonable expenses (including legal fees) related to investigating such breach and collecting such fees.</p>

<p>You acknowledge and agree that: (1) the damages that we will sustain as a result of your breach of this User Agreement will be substantial and will potentially include (without limitation) fines and other related expenses imposed on us by our payment processors and Users and that those damages may be extremely difficult and impracticable to ascertain; (2) if you breach this User Agreement, we may fine you up to US$3,000 for each breach and/or we may take legal action against you to recover losses that are in excess of the fine amount; (3) a fine of up to US$3,000 is a presently reasonable pre-estimate or minimum estimate of our damages, considering all currently existing circumstances, including (without limitation) the relationship of the sum to the range of harm to us that reasonably could be anticipated and the anticipation that proof of actual damages may be impractical or extremely difficult; and (4) we may release the entire (or part of the) amount of the fine from your Account to us.</p>

<p>If we close your Account for a reason other than as a result of your breach of this User Agreement, unless as otherwise specified in this User Agreement, you will be entitled to receive any payment due from us to you.</p>

<p>In the event that we close your Account, you will have no claim whatsoever against us in respect of any such suspension or termination of your Account.</p>

<h1><strong>24. Milestone Payments</strong></h1>

<p>Subject to Section 25, we do not operate an escrow service in relation to the Website. Showskills separately owns and operates a business known as Escrow.com - for the avoidance of doubt this business is separate and there is no connection between terms, conditions, products and services offered on Showskills and services offered on Escrow.com. We do however, provide a service on this Website which allows controlled payments to be made with respect to a service, called Milestone Payments.</p>

<p>Subject to the User Contract, the Buyer can make a Milestone Payment subject to Section 25, which will be locked from the Buyer's Account and cannot be claimed by the Seller until:</p>

<p>1. the Buyer and Seller agree that the funds can be claimed by the Seller;</p>

<p>2. if there is a dispute, the Buyer and Seller have concluded the Dispute Resolution Process and the Dispute is resolved in the Seller's favour;</p>

<p>3. the Buyer instructs us to pay a Seller for services performed by the Seller in respect of a Project or Contest; or</p>

<p>4. the Buyer acknowledges that the Seller has completed the services fully and satisfactory.</p>

<p>If a Buyer does not approve of the Seller's work product, the parties may elect to resolve the issue under the Dispute Resolution Process.</p>

<p>If we have not received any instructions or dispute from a Buyer or Seller in respect of a Milestone Payment within six months or any other reasonable length of time after the day that the Milestone Payment was paid and the Buyer has not logged into their Account during that time, the Milestone Payment will be unlocked and released back to the Buyer.</p>

<h1><strong>25. Requirements for Californian Users and Milestone Payments</strong></h1>

<p>In the state of California, United States of America, Milestone Payments are regarded as regulated escrow activity.</p>

<p>This Section deals with and applies to Milestone Payments that are connected to California, i.e. where a User, being a Buyer or a Seller, is ordinarily resident in California, United States of America (“California User” or “California Users”).</p>

<p>So that we can continue to serve our California Users, Escrow.com (a business owned and separately operated by Showskills) will facilitate escrow transactions on behalf of a Buyer and/or Seller either of whom is a California User, and to hold the funds in relation to any Project. Until further notice, there will be no additional Fees for facilitating an escrow transaction initiated as a result of this Section.</p>

<p>Where a California User is a Buyer or Seller in relation to any Project, and a Buyer seeks to initiate a Milestone Payment, the Users will be directed to complete Milestone Payments through Escrow.com as a Transaction (‘California Transaction”) in accordance with the Escrow.com Terms of Use and General Escrow Instructions.</p>

<p>The Escrow.com Group includes Escrow.com Inc. and Internet Escrow Services, Inc (“IES”) which are owned and operated by a wholly owned subsidiary in the Showskills Group. IES is a licensed Escrow Agent in the state of California holding Escrow Agent License No. 9631867, issued by the California Department of Business Oversight. As part of using the Escrow.com service you authorise Showskills to share your information with the Escrow.com Group to complete Escrow.com’s identity verification and know your customer procedures.</p>

<p>On completion of the work related to the Milestone Payment, the Seller will direct IES to disburse the proceeds of the Escrow.com Transaction to the User’s Account with Showskills.</p>

<p><strong>Accepted Currencies for Milestone Payments and California Users</strong></p>

<p>Escrow.com currently supports Transactions in three currencies; U.S. Dollars, Euros and Australian Dollars (“Supported Currencies”). If a Buyer's Payment Method is denominated in a currency other than the supported currencies, a currency conversion will be required for the Milestone Payment to be made and an Escrow.com Transaction to proceed. We will display foreign currency conversion rates that Showskills, Escrow, or our Affiliates currently make available to convert supported foreign currencies to one of the Supported Currencies.</p>

<p>These foreign currency conversion rates adjust regularly based on market conditions. Wholesale currency conversion rates at which Showskills or our Affiliates obtain foreign currency will usually be different than the foreign currency conversion rates offered on the Site. Each User, in its sole discretion and risk, may authorize the charge, debit, or credit of its Payment Method in a supported foreign currency and the conversion of the payment to one of the supported currencies at the foreign currency conversion rate displayed on the Site. A list of supported foreign currencies is available on the Site. If foreign currency conversion is required to make a payment in one of the Supported Currencies and either Showskills, Escrow, or our Affiliates does not support the foreign currency or the User does not authorize the conversion of such payment at the foreign currency conversion rate displayed on the Site, Escrow or one of our Affiliates will charge, debit, or credit the User's Payment Method and the User's Payment Method provider will convert the payment at a foreign currency conversion rate selected by the User's Payment Method provider. The User's Payment Method provider may also charge fees directly to the Payment Method even when no currency conversion is involved. The User's authorization of a payment using a foreign currency conversion rate displayed on the Site is at the User's sole risk. Showskills, Escrow, and our Affiliates are not responsible for currency fluctuations that occur when billing or crediting a Payment Method denominated in a currency other than one of the Supported Currencies. Showskills, Escrow, and our Affiliates are not responsible for currency fluctuations that occur when receiving or sending payments to and from the Escrow Account.</p>

<p><strong>Release and Delivery of Amounts in Escrow</strong></p>

<p>Buyers and Sellers in a California Transaction irrevocably authorize and instruct IES to release applicable portions of the Milestone Payment in an Escrow Account (each portion, a “Release”) to their Seller Escrow Account or in the event of a refund, the Buyer Escrow Account, as applicable, upon the occurrence of and in accordance with one or more Release Conditions provided below or as otherwise required by applicable law or the Terms of Service. The amount of any Release will be delivered to the applicable Showskills Account in accordance with Seller’s or Buyer’s authorization, as above, these Instructions, and the IES Terms of Service and General Escrow Instructions.</p>

<p>As used in these Instructions, “Release Condition” means any of the following:</p>

<p>1. Buyer clicks to release funds to Seller.</p>

<p>2. Buyer does not take any action for 14 days from the date of a Seller’s Release request, in which case Seller and Buyer agree that IES is authorized and irrevocably instructed to immediately release to Seller the amount associated in the applicable milestone in connection with such Release request.</p>

<p>3. Seller cancels the contract before a Milestone Payment has been released to Seller, in which case the funds are to be returned to the Buyer.</p>

<p>4. Buyer and Seller have submitted joint written instructions for a Release to either Seller Escrow Account or Buyer Escrow Account, as applicable.</p>

<p>5. Buyer and Seller agree to close the contract without release of funds, in which case the funds are to be returned to the Buyer.</p>

<p>6. Buyer or Seller has failed to make its Arbitration payment or paid its fair share of the Arbitration costs pursuant to the Dispute Resolution Service, in which case the funds are released to the Party that has made its Arbitration Payment.</p>

<p>7. Both Buyer and Seller have failed to timely submit to Arbitration for an unresolved Dispute as such term is defined in the Dispute Resolution Service, in which case the funds are released to the Buyer.</p>

<p>8. Buyer or Seller has failed timely to respond to a Showskills Dispute Resolution Service notification as required by the Dispute Resolution Service, in which case the funds are released to the User that has participated.</p>

<p>9. Buyer or Seller otherwise has failed to comply with the Dispute Resolution Service, in which case the funds are to be released to the User that has complied with the Dispute Resolution Service.</p>

<p>10. Submittal of a final award of an arbitrator appointed pursuant to the Dispute Resolution Service, in which case the funds will be released in accordance with such award.</p>

<p>11. Issuance of the final order of a court of competent jurisdiction from which appeal is not taken, in which case the funds will be released in accordance with such order.</p>

<p>12. Showskills believes, in our sole discretion, that fraud, non-payment, illegal act, or a violation of Showskills’s User Agreement has been committed or is being committed or attempted, in which case Buyer and Seller irrevocably authorize and instruct IES to take such actions as Showskills deems appropriate in our sole discretion and in accordance with applicable law, in order to prevent or remedy such acts, including without limitation to return the funds associated with such acts to their source of payment.</p>

<h1><strong>26. Milestone Dispute Resolution Services</strong></h1>

<p>Showskills offers Milestone Dispute Resolution Services to Users who have elected to use the Milestone Payment feature. You agree and acknowledge that: (i) Showskills is not providing legal services; (ii) Showskills will not advise you regarding any legal matters; and (iii) if you desire to have legal counsel, you will seek an independent legal counsel from those licensed to practice law in your jurisdiction. You will not rely on Showskills for any such counsel.</p>

<p>In the event of a dispute between a Buyer and a Seller regarding a return or release of Milestone Payments, either Buyer or Seller may elect to use the Milestone Dispute Resolution Services offered by Showskills as set out in the Milestone Disputes Policy.

<h1><strong>28. Disputes With Us</strong></h1>

<p>If a dispute arises between you and Showskills, our goal is to address your concerns immediately and, if we are unable to do so to your satisfaction, to provide you with a means of resolving the dispute quickly. We strongly encourage you to first contact us directly to seek a resolution by using our customer support website or emailing us at <a href="https://d.docs.live.net/8ff12ab844b4d8a0/Documents/showskills2021@gmail.com">showskills2021@gmail.com</a>.</p>

<p>For any claim, Showskills may elect to resolve the dispute in a cost effective manner through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. If Showskills elects arbitration, such arbitration will be initiated through an established alternative dispute resolution (ADR) provider, which is to be selected by you from a panel of ADR providers that Showskills will provide to you. The ADR provider and the parties must comply with the following rules: a) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; b) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and c) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>

<p>All claims you bring against Showskills must be resolved in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. All claims filed or brought contrary to this Agreement shall be considered improperly filed and a breach of this Agreement. Should you file a claim contrary to the terms of this Agreement, Showskills may recover its legal fees and costs (including in-house lawyers and paralegals), provided that Showskills has notified you in writing of the improperly filed claim, and you have failed to promptly withdraw the claim.</p>

<p>You agree that you will not pursue any claims arising under this User Agreement on a class or other representative basis and will not seek to coordinate or consolidate any arbitration or action hereunder with any other proceeding.</p>

<p>If any proceeding by or against you is commenced under any provision of any bankruptcy or insolvency law, Showskills will be entitled to recover all reasonable costs or expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred in connection with the enforcement of this Agreement.</p>

<p>Showskills's failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches.</p>

<h1><strong>29. Currencies</strong></h1>

<p>Some of the Websites will display rates in the local currency of that Website, in addition to the actual amount. These rates are based on a conversion from the originating currency using indicative market exchange rates. You understand and agree that these rates are only indicative and the amount specified in the origin currency is the actual amount.</p>

<p>As a convenience service, you may withdraw funds from the Website in another currency. If you wish to do so, you will be quoted an exchange rate which will be available for the time specified, which you may choose to accept. We may charge a fee for effecting the currency conversion transactions. This fee will be embedded within the rate provided to you and the currency exchange will be settled immediately.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to reject any request for a conversion of currency at any time.</p>

<p>You are responsible for all risks associated with converting and maintaining funds in various available currencies, including but not limited to the risk that the value of these funds will fluctuate as exchange rates change, which could result in decreases in the value of your funds in aggregate. You must not use (or attempt to use) the Website to engage in speculative trading, which could result in substantial losses. We are not a financial services provider.</p>

<p>All information included on the Website in respect of currency conversion is general information only. Use of currency conversion is at your own risk. Currency conversions are final and irreversible.</p>

<h1><strong>30. Contests</strong></h1>

<p>Buyers can promote a Contest hosted on the Website by providing a Contest Brief and paying the Contest Prize in accordance to our instructions provided on the Website. A Buyer acknowledges and agrees that it is solely responsible for the operation and promotion of the Contest and warrants that it will comply with all applicable law in respect of the operation and promotion of the Contest. We have no liability for loss suffered by a User in connection with a Contest including but not limited to loss suffered (or penalties imposed) in connection with any contravention of law.</p>

<p>Entrants may submit their entries in image, video, text or other format as specified on the Website. All entries must comply with the Contest Brief and must not infringe any Intellectual Property Rights. Any entry which infringes any Intellectual Property Rights will be an ineligible entry and subject to removal either by the Buyer or us and subject to action as per our Copyright Infringement Policy.</p>

<p>Buyers can promote either: (1) a regular prepaid Contest, under which a Buyer may select one or more winning Entrant(s) and Buyers may request that the Contest Prize be released to them if a winner has not been chosen within 30 days of the Contest closing date; or (2) a guaranteed Contest, under which a Buyer may select one or more winning Seller(s) and if no winner is selected, we will release the Contest Prize to Entrants of the guaranteed Contest and charge the appropriate fees and the Buyer will have no rights to have the Contest Prize released to them or to use any entries that have been submitted. After 30 days of the Contest closing date, we reserve the right to distribute the Contest prize to the participating Sellers.</p>

<p>After awarding a Contest Prize, the Buyer and winning Entrant(s) will enter into a Contest Handover and when the winning Entrant(s) has uploaded the winning entry (including all related files) to the Buyer, the Contest Prize will be released to the winner of the Contest unless disputed by the Buyer in which case the dispute must be resolved between the Buyer and winning Entrant(s) before we can release the Contest Prize to the winning Entrant(s).</p>

<p>For avoidance of doubt, the Buyer has no right or licence to use any entries other than the winning entry/entries. The Buyer may not: (1) promote a Contest via the Website if the Buyer is hosting a similar Contest through another service; (2) allow or request Sellers to submit entries to the Buyer via other means than the Website; and (3) award another Account that might be deemed as collusion or awarding another Account owned by the Buyer.</p>
